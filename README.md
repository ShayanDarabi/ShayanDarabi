- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ShayanDarabi
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Science and ML
- ğŸŒ± I've taken some courses in python and ML and I'm learning new things which are related to field of data. It's fascinating that what stories can be narrated by analyzing
      the data. If you are also into playing with data like me, you know what I'm talking about :)
